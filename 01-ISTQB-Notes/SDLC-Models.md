# SDLC Models

Software projects can follow different models depending on requirements and flexibility.  

---

## 1. Waterfall Model
- Linear and sequential model.  
- Each phase must finish before the next begins.  
- Easy to understand but **hard to change** once started.  
- Example: Build full website, then test at the end.  

---

## 2. Agile Model
- Iterative and flexible model.  
- Software is developed in small parts (iterations or sprints).  
- Easy to adapt to changes.  
- Example: Build login first, then cart, then checkout, every 2 weeks.

---

## 3. Scrum
- A framework inside Agile.  
- Work is done in **Sprints** (usually 2 weeks).  
- Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.  
- Daily standups, reviews, and retrospectives.

## 4. Kanban
- Visual workflow method.  
- Focus on **continuous delivery** and limiting work in progress.  
- Uses boards with columns like **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Done**.  
- Example: Track tasks for development and testing visually.
