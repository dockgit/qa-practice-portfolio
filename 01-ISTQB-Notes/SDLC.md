# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

**Definition:**  
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by developers and software teams to design, develop, test, and deliver high-quality software in a systematic way.  

It ensures that software is built efficiently, meets requirements, and works as expected.

## Phases of SDLC

1. **Requirement Analysis**  
   - Understand what the client or user wants.  
   - Gather requirements and document them clearly.  
   - Example: “The app should allow users to add products to a cart.”

2. **Planning**  
   - Decide project timeline, budget, and resources.  
   - Make a roadmap for how the software will be developed.

3. **Design**  
   - Plan how the software will look and work.  
   - Create diagrams, UI mockups, database structure.  
   - Example: Design login page layout, database tables for users.

4. **Development / Implementation**  
   - Actual coding starts here.  
   - Developers write the software based on design.  
   - Example: Build login functionality using React and API.

5. **Testing**  
   - QA team checks if software works correctly.  
   - Find bugs, errors, and report them.  
   - Example: Test if login fails with wrong password.

6. **Deployment**  
   - Launch the software to users or production environment.  
   - Example: Upload the website to live server.

7. **Maintenance**  
   - Fix issues, update software, add new features over time.  
   - Example: Add “forgot password” feature after initial release.
