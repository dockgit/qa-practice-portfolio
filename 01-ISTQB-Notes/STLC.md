# Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

**Definition:**  
STLC is a set of steps followed by QA teams to ensure software is tested thoroughly and meets quality standards.

---

## 6 STLC Phases

1. **Requirement Analysis**  
   - QA studies requirements to understand what to test.  
   - Example: Check if login should allow social login, password rules, etc.

2. **Test Planning**  
   - Decide **what to test, how to test, resources, and timeline**.  
   - Example: Plan to test login, cart, and checkout in 2 weeks.

3. **Test Case Design / Test Development**  
   - Write detailed **test cases** and prepare **test data**.  
   - Example: Test Case: "Login fails with incorrect password."

4. **Test Environment Setup**  
   - Prepare the environment where testing will be done.  
   - Example: Browser versions, mobile devices, or staging server.

5. **Test Execution**  
   - Run test cases and record results.  
   - Report any defects/bugs found.  
   - Example: Login test fails → log defect in Jira.

6. **Test Closure**  
   - Summarize testing results, report metrics, lessons learned.  
   - Example: Total bugs found, bugs fixed, pending issues.
